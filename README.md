# serra.boten.ca

## Hello! Welcome to my wwwwebsite.

This 'live resume' was one of the first projects I built in React. Every time I looka the code I want to delete / refactor everything, but I am resisting this urge. It works, even if it's slightly janky and perpetually out of date. 

## Automatic Deployment

Commiting a change to the main branch of this repo automatically kicks off a test build thanks to integration with Netlify's automatic deployment workflow. Sweet!

## To Do

- refactor everything
- reimplement animations
- Dockerize
- stop looking at this code and go work on something useful
